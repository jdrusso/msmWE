Welcome to msm_we's documentation!
==================================

This is a package for doing history-augmented MSM (haMSM) analysis on weighted ensemble trajectories.

Weighted ensemble data produced from simulations with recycling boundary conditions are naturally in a directional
ensemble.
This means that a history label can be assigned to every trajectory.
