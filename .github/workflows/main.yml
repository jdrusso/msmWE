# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. 
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the master branch
  push:
    branches: [ documentation ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:

    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
    # Standard drop-in approach that should work for most people.
#     - uses: ammaraskar/sphinx-action@master
#       with:
#         docs-folder: "docs/"
    # Example of using a custom build-command.
    - uses: ammaraskar/sphinx-action@master

#     - uses: ammaraskar/sphinx-action@master
#       with:
#         pre-build-command: "apt-get update -y && apt-get install -y latexmk texlive-latex-recommended texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-recommended"
#         build-command: "make latexpdf"
#         docs-folder: "docs2/"
    # Great extra actions to compose with:
    # Create an artifact of the html output.
